# VacuumCleaner2D

VacuumCleaner2D is a 2D game designed for educational purposes, focusing on teaching concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this game, players or AI agents control a vacuum cleaner to clean a virtual environment. The project is intended to support experiments and demonstrations in AI, including reinforcement learning and agent-based control.

## Features

- 2D vacuum cleaner simulation
- Designed for AI education and research
- Supports custom controllers and sensors
- Easily extensible for new experiments

## Requirements

- Godot Engine 4.x with C# support
- .NET 8.0
- AI4U - https://github.com/gilzamir18/ai4u

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Godot Engine.
3. Run the python script in pyscripts/run.py to start a randomic agent.
4. Run the main scene to start the simulation.
